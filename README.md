MIRANDA (ground + objects)
-------------------------

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nardinan/miranda.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nardinan/miranda)

Note: Miranda is a 160 characters-per-row library!

This is just another attempt to create a powerful library with an object-oriented interface. The main idea here is to implement virtual tables and inheritance in "objects".

At the current state there is only a single test file in the "test" directory (which, after the classical procedure 'make + make install' of Miranda, can be compiled with `gcc -lmiranda_ground -lmiranda_objects test.one.c -o test.one`)
