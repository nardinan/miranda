MIRANDA (ground + objects)
-------------------------
My personal library
------------------------

Note: Miranda is a 160 characters-per-row library!

This is just another attempt to create a powerful library with an object-oriented interface. The main idea here is to implement virtual tables and 
inheritance in "objects".

At the current state no test sources are available!
